#+title: AE 8900 Timeline
#+author: Alexander Bustos

** Basically
   1. Setup environments/dependencies/stuff.
   2. Develop data collection and visualization functionality.
   3. Utilize the above functionality to develop long-running automated test functionality.
   4. Extend system to support different configurations.
   5. Develop a CI/CD pipeline to build new releases.

** Core Project Functionality
   - Real-time data visualization
   - Long-running validation testing (jobs?)
   - Analog data collection (voltages)
   - Digital data collection (messages over hardware interfaces)
   - Multiple configuration support
   - Data recording and reviewing

** Core Goals
   - Learn more about test automation
   - Learn more about full stack web development
   - Learn more about what makes a... good developer experience.
   - Develop using current best practices
   - Learn more about dev tools in general, like good CI/CD practices, while also avoiding
     overcomplicating things

** Week 0, 05/15/2023 - 05/21/2023
*** Goals
    - [X] Determine project topic.

** Week 1, 05/22/2023 - 05/28/2023
*** Goals
    - [X] Determine project tech stack.

** Week 2, 05/29/2023 - 06/04/2023
*** Goals
    - [X] Set up project git repo.
    - [X] Scaffold frontend and backend. All I mean by this is use existing tools to set up each
      section of the project using best practices.
    - [X] Flash Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS Lite (or Arch for ARM?).

** Week 3, 06/05/2023 - 06/11/2023
*** Goals
    - [ ] Prototype frontend structure. I expect this goal (and the one below it) to continue in
      future weeks.
    - [ ] Prototype backend structure.
    - [ ] Identify hardware sensors for demo System Under Test.
*** Demos
    - [ ] A sort of "Hello World" demo between the frontend and the backend, showing that they can
      communicate with each other.

** Week 4, 06/12/2023 - 06/18/2023
*** Goals
    - [ ] Prototype real-time data collection using Raspberry Pi hardware interfaces.
    - [ ] Prototype system under test demonstrator; verify that it can interact with the Pi.

** Week 5, 06/19/2023 - 06/25/2023
*** Goals
    - [ ] Continue developing frontend and backend as needed.
    - [ ] Prototype test-running capability.

*** Demos
    - [ ] Demonstrate real-time data visualization using real sensor data.

** Week 6, 06/26/2023 - 07/02/2023
*** Goals
    - [ ] Prototype multiple configurations.
    - [ ] Continue developing test-running capability.
*** Demos
    - [ ] Demonstrate different layouts/APIs when switching configurations.

** Week 7, 07/03/2023 - 07/09/2023
*** Goals
    - [ ] Continue developing test-running capability.
    - [ ] Continue developing multiple configuration capability as needed.
*** Demos
    - [ ] Demonstrate a simple, long running test using real data.

** Week 8, 07/10/2023 - 07/16/2023
*** Goals
    - [ ] Begin writing report.
    - [ ] Create Raspberry Pi image with project software pre-installed.
*** Demos

** Week 9, 07/17/2023 - 07/23/2023
*** Goals
    - [ ] Continue writing report as needed.
    - [ ] Investigate developing a GitHub Actions pipeline to automatically build new images for new
      versions.

** Week 10, 07/24/2023 - 07/30/2023
*** Goals
    - [ ] Continue writing report as needed.
    - [ ] Continue developing GitHub Actions pipeline for building images.
*** Demos
    - [ ] Demonstrate CI/CD functionality for automatically building images.

** Week 11, 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023
*** Goals
    - [ ] Review and proofread report.
